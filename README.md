This is an administrative interface for soccer scouting data, and a learning exercise for me to experiment with Angular.js.

It currently accepts player data in the following format:

{
    "PlayerID": "2272",
    "PlayerName": "Chris Seitz",
    "Position": "Goalkeeper",
    "RosterNumber": "0",
    "Height_Feet": "6",
    "Height_Inches": "3",
    "Birthplace": "San Luis Obispo, CA",
    "Citizenship": "United States",
    "Weight": "236",
    "DOB": "1987-03-12",
    "TeamID": "16",
    "GP": "10",
    "GS": "10",
    "Minutes": "900",
    "Ejections": "0",
    "LastPlayed": "2014-05-31 20:30:00"
}
